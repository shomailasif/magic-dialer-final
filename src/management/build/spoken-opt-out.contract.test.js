/**
 * A spoken follow-up refusal must suppress the number.
 *
 * On the call of 13 Oct the prospect said "I don't want you to follow-up". That
 * is the only opt-out in the entire conversation, and it suppressed nothing:
 *
 *   isSpokenOptOut() knew six phrases - stop calling, don't call, do not call,
 *   remove me, take me off, unsubscribe - and none of them match it.
 *
 * So doNotCall stayed false, consentStatus stayed UNKNOWN, the phoneSuppression
 * row was never written, and the agent's correct, polite ending changed nothing.
 * The next campaign called the same person again. Honouring a refusal on the call
 * while persisting none of it is the worst of both worlds: it looks compliant and
 * behaves exactly like an agent that never heard the refusal.
 *
 * The cost of a false positive here is permanent and asymmetric against us, so
 * the other half of this file matters as much as the first: every phrase that
 * must NOT suppress is asserted just as loudly.
